# GNR650_Perceiver_23d1387_24d0295
In this repository, we tried replicating the 'Perceiver: General Perception with Iterative Attention' paper, which can be read here (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03206).






Thank you for having a look at this repository. I hope you had a good time and great learning. This work is done by Priyanka Talwar and Danny Savla (collaborator of this repository) to fulfill the course work GNR650 â€” Advanced Topics in Deep Learning for Image Analysis by Prof. Biplab Banerjee.
