# Installation 
- Download the code base: git clone https://github.com/talwarp1708/GNR650_Perceiver_23d1387_24d0295.git

- Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
or Uncomment the first line as mentioned in the ipynb file and execute 
!pip install torchgeo perceiver-pytorch evaluate datasets 

# Usage
- Update the root folder in Perceiver_23D1387_24D0295.ipynb/.py file, which contains the train.zip file of CustomMillionAID train_ds = CustomMillionAID(root='./data', task="multi-class", split="train")

- Update the save_dir to save the models: save_dir  = 'your directory'

- Update the output_filename in the train() to save the logs per batch execution: output_filename = 'Your file path'

# Execute 
- Execute the file .py or .ipynb file

# Results
- View the results in the output_filename for loss and accruacy results during training. The validation results are available on command line
